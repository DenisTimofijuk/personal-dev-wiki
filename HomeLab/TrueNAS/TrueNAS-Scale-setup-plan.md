# TrueNAS SCALE – Post-Installation Checklist (Home Use)

 - **Create an admin user:** After installation, use the UI to create a non-root “admin” user and disable the default root login. Newer SCALE versions deprecate root access, so configure all permissions under an administrative user. Also set that user’s email address (in Credentials → Local Users) so TrueNAS can send system notifications to you .
 - **Network setup:** Assign a fixed IP (or ensure DHCP reservation) for the SCALE server so its address doesn’t change. In System Settings → Network, configure hostname, IP, gateway and DNS as needed. It’s easiest and safest to do this via the web UI (which has safeguards to prevent misconfiguration). For multiple NICs, you can create a LAGG or VLAN in Network, but for a simple home lab one interface is usually enough.
 - **Boot device and logs:** If your OS is on a small USB stick or old SSD, minimize its wear by moving logs and app data to the pool. Under System Settings → Advanced enable “System Dataset Pool” and point it to your data pool, and enable “Use System Dataset” for syslog. This directs system logs and charts into the pool instead of the boot drive. With this, most writes go to the pool’s disks (or an internal SSD) instead of the flash boot media. Backup config: also immediately download the system configuration file (System Settings → General → Manage Configuration → Download) and keep it safe. That way you can restore all settings if you ever reinstall SCALE.
 - **Check for updates:** Go to System → Updates and install any pending patches. Before major upgrades, save a new boot environment and back up your config. TrueNAS will even prompt you when new releases are available.

## Storage and Datasets

  - **Verify your pool:** Make sure your 2‑disk mirror is ONLINE and healthy (see Storage → Disks/Pool). By default ZFS compression (LZ4) is enabled, which is good. If you want, you can enable deduplication or encryption on new datasets, but for media storage these are optional. Plan your datasets now: e.g. create separate datasets for Media, Photos, Backups, etc. Use Storage → Datasets to add them under your pool.
  - **Dataset settings:** For each dataset, consider setting share-friendly ACLs. In a home environment it’s common to use POSIX (UNIX) ACL mode so permissions are simple. For example, after creating datasets you can set ACL Mode: POSIX (Open) on each, which effectively allows any authenticated user to read/write (often fine for family use). You can tighten these later with specific ACL entries or user permissions if needed. It’s usually best not to use restrictive Windows ACL mode on a home NAS unless you really need per-file security.
  - **Shares**: Enable and configure the file-sharing service you need. For mixed Windows/Mac home networks, turn on SMB (the SMB service) and create SMB shares for each dataset (via Shares → Windows (SMB)). Linux clients can use Shares → UNIX (NFS) if desired. Remember to start the SMB/NFS services in System Settings → Services. For simplicity, give the SMB share the same name as the dataset (e.g. “Media”) and allow your main user accounts to access it.
  - **Pool health tasks**: ZFS needs periodic scans. SCALE creates a default scrub task that runs weekly by default (usually Sunday). A scrub scans all data for corruption. This is important: it will detect silent bit-rot and ensure redundancy. You can keep the weekly scrub or adjust it in Tasks → Scrub Tasks. For a mostly-read pool, even a monthly scrub is often acceptable in home use, but running it weekly adds safety.
  - **SMART tests**: Enable S.M.A.R.T. monitoring on each disk (Storage → Disks → Expand a disk → Edit → Enable S.M.A.R.T.*). Then schedule S.M.A.R.T. tests under Data Protection → S.M.A.R.T. Tests. A common schedule is short tests weekly and long tests monthly. (Short tests take minutes; long tests scan the entire disk.) Do not schedule a SMART test at the same time as a scrub. TrueNAS documentation warns to run tests during low-usage periods and avoid conflicts. After each test or scan, check Storage → Disks → disk → “S.M.A.R.T. Test Results” for any issues.

  ## Data Protection

  - **Snapshots**: Use ZFS snapshots to protect your data. Go to Data Protection → Periodic Snapshot Tasks and add a task for each dataset you want to snapshot (or do the whole pool). Snapshots are quick, incremental “point-in-time” views. For home media, you might snapshot your media and documents daily (or every few hours during the day) and keep a rolling window (e.g. keep hourly for 24h, daily for a week, weekly for a month). The exact scheme depends on your needs, but even a daily snapshot with 30‑day retention can recover deleted or changed files. (Snapshots do not duplicate all data – if nothing changed it uses zero extra space.)
  - **Replication/Backups**: Snapshots help locally, but also consider off-site backups. If you have another NAS or TrueNAS system, use Data Protection → Replication Tasks to send snapshots over the LAN or Internet. Otherwise, use Cloud Sync Tasks to back up important datasets to a cloud provider (TrueNAS supports S3, Google Drive, Backblaze B2, etc). Cloud Sync can push (upload) a dataset to the cloud on a schedule. For example, you could periodically sync your “Photos” dataset to Google Drive or B2 for safe-keeping. (TrueNAS docs note that cloud sync is “an effective method to back up data to a remote location”.)

  ## File Sharing & Services

  - **SMB/NFS Service**: In System Settings → Services, enable SMB (and/or NFS if needed). Click the pencil to edit SMB settings (most defaults are fine for home). Similarly enable SSH if you want command-line access. You can optionally enable SNMP for monitoring, or the Rsync service if you need rsync modules (e.g. for one-way file transfers). After enabling, make sure to start the service.
  - **UPS (if available)**: If your server is on a UPS, enable the UPS service in System Settings → Services. Configure it with your UPS type (e.g. "apc" for APC) and USB path. This allows TrueNAS to initiate a safe shutdown if power fails.
  - **Time and Update Checks**: Ensure NTP is working so the clock stays accurate (by default SCALE syncs time). Also, regularly check System → Updates. Before applying updates, save your config and create a new boot environment (TrueNAS will remind you). After updates, verify all services and pools are running OK.

  ## Apps, Containers and Remote Access

  TrueNAS SCALE’s biggest advantage is built-in container orchestration. To use it:  

  - **Add App catalogs**: In Apps → Manage Catalogs, add any useful catalogs. For example, add the TrueCharts catalog by clicking Add and pasting https://github.com/truecharts/catalog. TrueCharts has many community-maintained apps (like Jellyfin, Nextcloud, Tailscale) beyond the official ones. After adding catalogs, check Apps → Available Applications.
  - **Adjust app settings (Host Path & Networking):** By default, TrueNAS prevents container apps from using the same dataset that’s already used by a system share (e.g. an SMB share). If you try to mount a host path (your dataset) into an app with Host Path Safety Checks on, you’ll get an error like: `“Invalid mount '/mnt/main/music' path. Following service(s) use this path: SMB Share”. (See screenshot below.)` 
  Screenshot: error when Host Path Safety Checks is enabled and an app tries to mount a dataset used by SMB.
  To fix this, go to Apps → Settings → Advanced and uncheck Enable Host Path Safety Checks. Also check Host Network so that app ports map directly to the NAS’s LAN IP (this lets you reach apps at http://<NAS-IP>:<port> on your home network). With these settings, apps can directly access your shared datasets.
  - **Install apps:** Now you can deploy containers. Common home uses include:
   - **Jellyfin** (media server) – install from Apps, giving it access to your media datasets.
   - **Tailscale** – a WireGuard-based VPN. Install the Tailscale app (from TrueCharts) so your NAS joins your Tailscale “tailnet”. This gives secure remote access without router port forwarding. (You can also make the NAS a Tailscale Subnet Router so all your LAN devices are reachable, as described in Tailscale docs.)
   - **Syncthing or Nextcloud** – for personal file sync/sharing.
   - **Photoprism** – for indexing a photo library (if you want an alternative to Google Photos).
   Consult the TrueNAS SCALE Apps documentation or community guides for each app’s setup. But remember: since you disabled Host Path Safety, your apps can mount the same dataset you’ve shared via SMB/NFS (e.g. Jellyfin can see your /mnt/Data/Media directory). Always test with small data first.

## Alerts, Email and Monitoring

 - **Email for system alerts:** Set up email so SCALE can notify you of issues. First, edit your admin user (Credentials → Local Users → admin → Edit) and add a real email address. Then go to System Settings → General → Email (or click the Alerts icon → Email). Enter your SMTP server (or use Gmail OAuth) and credentials, and send a test email to verify. TrueNAS will then send nightly health reports to that address (including scrub/SMART errors, pool status, etc).
 - **Alert service**: In the top Alert panel, click the gear icon and open Alert Settings. Under Alert Services, add an Email service and put your address in the field. Leave the level at “Warning” (default) so you get emails for any serious warnings. Use “Send Test Alert” to confirm it works. From now on, events like a failing disk, low space, or SMART errors will trigger an email to you.
 - **Dashboard and logs**: The TrueNAS Dashboard and Alerts panel will show any current problems (e.g. degraded pool, over-threshold temperature, etc). You can customize which alerts are considered important. Periodically check Reporting → Alerts History and Reporting → Graphs for disk stats or other anomalies.

 ## Ongoing Maintenance

  - **Regular tasks**: Periodically log in to verify that scrubs and snapshots have run, and that all disks are healthy (Storage → Disks shows SMART status). Review the periodic tasks schedules (snapshots, scrubs, SMART) to ensure they’re still as you want.
  - **Software updates**: TrueNAS SCALE updates frequently. When you see an update, download your config backup, create a new boot environment, and apply it via System → Updates. After updates, confirm all services (SMB, apps, network) come up normally.
  - **Backups of config**: Each time you make significant changes (new user, new shares, etc), download the config file again. Store it off the NAS (email it to yourself, save to cloud drive, etc). This single file will restore users, shares, and most settings.
  - **Future considerations**: As your needs grow, you could add more drives or set up replication to another location. For now, ensure your most important data (e.g. irreplaceable photos) is backed up either via Cloud Sync or an external USB job. If you use a UPS, test that it will shut down the NAS gracefully on battery (in System → Settings → Advanced you may configure UPS shutdown behavior).


  Following these steps will give you a solid, maintainable TrueNAS SCALE home server. You’ll have a reliable mirrored pool with regular integrity checks (scrubs/SMART), recoverable snapshots, email alerts for any issues, and the ability to run useful apps like Jellyfin and Tailscale.
